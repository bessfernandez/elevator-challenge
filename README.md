# elevator-challenge
A set of objects that manage elevator movement and interaction between the elevators. 

Uses an Elevator Class (elevator itself) and ElevatorSimulator Class (kind of like the hub of all the elevators aka a Controller) combined with an ElevatorState Class which allows for communication between different classes and an ongoing ability to see and update state as requests are made.

I have made TODO comments for the pieces I have not gotten to and need to be refactored.

You can run script via `node index.js`
